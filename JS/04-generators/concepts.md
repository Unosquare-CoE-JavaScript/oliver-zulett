# Generators

A generator is a special function that returns an iterator object, which can be used to generate a series of values according to a custom algorithm. The generator function is defined using the "function\*" keyword, followed by the function name and its arguments, if it has any.

The generator function uses the "yield" keyword to produce a value at each iteration and stop the execution of the function until the next call to the "next()" method of the iterator. Each call to the "next()" method returns an object with two properties: "value" and "done". The "value" property contains the value generated by the "yield", and the "done" property indicates whether the function has finished generating values.

example:

```js
function* generateValues() {
  yield 1
  yield 2
  yield 3
}

const generator = generateValues()

console.log(generator.next().value) // Output: 1
console.log(generator.next().value) // Output: 2
console.log(generator.next().value) // Output: 3
console.log(generator.next().done) // Output: true
```

we can pass values to generator from outside

example:

```js
function* generator() {
  let value = yield
  console.log(`Value received from the next() method: `, value)
  // 100
}

generator.next(100)
```
